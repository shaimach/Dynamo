DYNAMO is a flexible framework for quantum optimal control algorithms.

It design is interesting in two ways

    * The computation needed to solve QOC problems is broken down into many sub-modules 
      (e.g. gradient function, step-size control, etc - details below), and for
      many building blocks more than one implementation is supplied.
      Technically, "function handles" (the MATLAB "@" symbols) are used to
      make capabilities plug-and-play.

    * DYNAMO attempts to minimize calculations by way of Delayed Calculations.
      Whenever a control field is modified, DYNAMO only marks that value as changed,
      and the values calculated from it (single-slice exponents, start-to-T and 
      T-to-end propagators, etc) as stale. Only when a specific value is needed
      (such as the current fidelity), are the calculations performed. At this point
      DYNAMO attempts to perform the minimal number of matrix exponentiations and 
      multiplications to arrive at the desired result.
      See the functions invalidate_timeslots_calc_cache, recompute_timeslots_now and
      update_timeslot_controls for the nitty-gritty details.

To learn DYNAMO in-depth, we suggest the following

    * Run run_me_dynamo_demo_00 and run_me_dynamo_demo_01
    * Study their code
    * Only then read the rest of this document
    * If you have any questions, email me (details at top) - I'll be happy to help

DYNAMO makes use of a single global structure, "OC" to maintain all the computational context.
Going through the structure will give you a better idea of how DYANMO works:

OC
    const -                     Various constants to be used both internally and by the DYNAMO user
        termination_reason -    Codes for the various termination reasons, returned by the high-level search functions
                                Limit values for the various causes below is supplied to the search functions in a structure
                                typically called "termination_reasons". See the demos for examples.
            goal_achieved -     Desired fidelity reached
            loop_count -        Maximal loop count reached
            wall_time -         Wall-time (i.e. clock) maximum time reached
            cpu_time -          CPU-time maximum reached
            gradient_norm -     Gradient norm fell below perscribed limits
        termination_reason_str - A cell-array of strings matching the numeric codes in OC.const.termination_reason
